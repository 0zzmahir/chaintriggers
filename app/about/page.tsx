      <h1>About ChainTriggers</h1>

      <p>
        ChainTriggers is an independent educational platform dedicated to
        explaining how specific events, behaviors, decisions, and circumstances
        can trigger legal, financial, regulatory, and risk-related outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our goal is to help readers better understand complex cause-and-effect
        relationships in areas such as insurance claims, liability exposure,
        employment disputes, regulatory compliance, financial risk, and
        consumer protection.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>

      <p>
        Modern legal and financial systems are often reactive. Many individuals
        and businesses only become aware of risks after a triggering event has
        already occurred. ChainTriggers exists to close this knowledge gap by
        providing clear, structured, and accessible explanations of common risk
        triggers before problems arise.
      </p>

      <h2>Educational Focus</h2>

      <p>
        All content published on ChainTriggers is created strictly for
        educational and informational purposes. We do not offer professional
        legal, medical, insurance, or financial advice, and nothing on this
        website should be interpreted as a substitute for consulting qualified
        professionals.
      </p>

      <h2>Content Integrity</h2>

      <p>

        We focus on factual explanations, general principles, and hypothetical

        under common conditions.
      </p>
